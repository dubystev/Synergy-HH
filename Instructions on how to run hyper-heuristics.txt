To run the hyper-heuristics in the src/hh_project directory
1.  Copy all the codes into the same source directory of your Java project

2a. Make sure you edit the following line
    args = new String[]{"1", "5", "6", "31", "507000"};
    in hh_run_batch.java to suit the algorithm you intend to test-run on the HyFlex domains.
2b. For example, the string aray element above can be explained as follows: The tester wants to run EA-ILS ("1") on the 6th instance ("6") of the 
    PS domain ("5") 31 times ("31"). Each run will be stopped after 507 secs ("507000").
2c. To further enhance understanding, the switch statement starting with the expression "switch(Domain){" controls which domain is used to test an algorithm
    while the other switch statment within the method void setHH() which is towards the end of hh_run_batch.java triggers the algorithm to run based on the
    integer parameter entered by the user in the <b>args</b> array.

3.  Notice there are two algorithms to choose from: TS-ILS (ILS_conf.java) and EA-ILS (EA_ILS_final.java). The switch statment in the setHH() method can be
    extended if there is a need to test another algorithm in the source code folder
    
4.  When you are set, run hh_run_batch.java (since it is the java file that has a main method) and wait until all the trials are completed.
