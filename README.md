# Synergy-HH
Implementing hyper-heuristic selection strategies towards creating a synergy between them.

Some existing selection hyper-heuristics by other authors are avaialble: TSHH.java was re-implemented based on the algorithm outlined in the paper (#1) that published it; 
FS-ILS (#2) was taken from the author's github page (https://github.com/Steven-Adriaensen/FS-ILS)

The folder named Result Data (https://github.com/dubystev/Synergy-HH/tree/master/Result%20Data) stores the raw median objective function values obtained by TS-ILS, an algorithm that improved on the workings of FS-ILS by incorporating some 
ideas in TSHH and presented in IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2021 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9504841). 

The source code for TS-ILS (#3) is named ILS_conf.java; https://github.com/dubystev/Synergy-HH/blob/master/src/hh_project/ILS_conf.java. The result files can be used as basis for comparing the algorithm's performance with other algorithms on the HyFlex test 
suite (containing benchmark instances for six different combinatorial optimization problems).
