From command line, type
java -jar hyper_heuristic_project <competing_algos> <problemDomain> <instance> <tally>

We define the following:
<competing_algos> is a comma-separated list of integers which represents the algorithms that will be
tested during the test-run
<problemDomain> is a single integer value representing the domain to be tackled by the competing algorithms
SAT := 0, BP := 1, PS := 2, PFS := 3, TSP := 4, VRP := 5
<instance> is an integer value that takes its value from the following set {1, 2, ..., 10} or {1, 2, ..., 11}
<tally> is an integer representing the numer of loops, i.e. the number of times each algorithm in the competing
algorithms set run on the set instance
